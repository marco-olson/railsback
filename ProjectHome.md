Railsback is an open source project designed to assist piano technicians in tuning by providing functions for measuring inharmonicity, calculating temperaments, and estimating over-pull percentages.  It is meant to be an open source alternative to programs like [Reyburn CyberTuner](http://www.reyburn.com), [Verituner](http://www.veritune.com), and [TuneLab](http://www.tunelab-world.com).
